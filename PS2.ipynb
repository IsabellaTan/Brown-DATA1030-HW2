    "\n",
    "Which Rhode Island school has the largest undergraduate student population? And graduate student population? You will collect and analyze data to answer these two questions using the College Scoreboard API of the U.S. Department of Education. An API (application point interface) is a mechanism which allows two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. The two software components in this case are your jupyter notebook running python and the College Scoreboard server. \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are a popular way to share and modify data in an automated, secure, and cost-efficient way. Read more about APIs [here](https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation of the College Scoreboard API is available [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/api-documentation), read it carefully. It is a REST API which means that we will perform operations using standard HTTP methods. We want to know the name of each RI school, in which city/town it is located, the zipcode, and how many undergrad and gradute students they have based on the most recent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use python packages like `requests`, `dotenv`, and `pandas` or `polars` to collect and save the data. \n",
    "- The `requests` package is how you will query the API. We will submit only one query to the College Scoreboard API which could in principle be done in a browser. However I want you write python code because often you need to make a large number of API requests which needs to be automated with code. Read more about it [here](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- One way APIs achieve security is to limit access to authorized users only. Authorized users have an API_KEY which is a secret key specific to each user. This API_KEY needs to be provided when you make a request to the server, it will be part of the HTTP URL. This is how the server knows who makes the request and what level of access the user has. While most users can have read access, only a limited number of users usually have access to modify a dataset. Therefore the API_KEY needs to be kep secret. **Your API_KEY should NEVER be directly copy-pasted into your notebook or pushed to any github repository!** If you do so, that's a security risk even if the repository is private. Also, you will lose points. A pretty popular way to share secrets like the API_KEY with your notebook is done by using the `dotenv` package. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv).\n",
    "- The API request will be returned in a json format. You will use `pandas` or `polars` to convert the json output to a dataframe, and save it as a csv file. \n",
